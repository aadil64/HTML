    <h1>Neymar da Silva</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In May 2021, Neymar signed a contract extension that ties him to Paris Saint-Germain until summer 2025.
        His new contract is packed with performance bonuses, including a massive bump if PSG wins the Champions League.
        His transfer from Barcelona to PSG stands as the most expensive in the world at $263 million, which the French club paid in full ahead of his signing.
        In 2020, Neymar announced an early exit from his contract with Nike's Jordan Brand and signed with Puma.
        In 2021, Epic Games announced that Neymar, an avid video gamer, would join the cast of "Fortnite" with an in-game skin.</p>

            Who weeps for Neymar? Not many people. Except perhaps Neymar himself, who cries a lot and not always out of sadness. A quick internet search of “Neymar tears” reveals 4.73 million hits, from Brazil tears to Barça tears, to brave tears, sad tears, tears as Neymar greets [insert celebrity friend], to full, cinematic hot salty snot-washing tears. So, so many tears</p>
